<h1>Permissions used within mcMMO</h1>
<p>Before reading further, it should be known that mcMMO permission nodes are set to default values which automatically ensure every player can use mcMMO properly and gives server operators access to admin tools within mcMMO, you can customize mcMMO permission nodes if you want but it should not be necessary unless you have your permission plugin set to deny all nodes by default for users on your server.</p>
<h2>Recommended Permissions</h2>
<p>The recommended permission to give players is <i><strong>mcmmo.defaults</strong></i> this gives players access to everything outside of admin tools</p>
