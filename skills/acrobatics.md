# Acrobatics

Acrobatics is the art of moving Gracefuly in mcMMO. It provides combat bonuses and environment damage bonuses.

## XP Gain

To gain XP in this skill you need to perform a dodge in combat or survive falls from heights that damage you.

## How does Rolling work?

You have a passive chance when you take fall damage to negate the damage done. You can hold the sneak button to double your chances during the fall. This triggers a Graceful Roll instead of a standard one. Graceful Rolls are like regular rolls but are twice as likely to occur and provide more damage safety than regular rolls. Rolling chance is tied to your skill level

## How does Dodge work?

Dodge is a passive chance when you are injured in combat to halve the damage taken. It is tied to your skill level.
