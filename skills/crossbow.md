# Crossbow

Crossbows is all about shooting with your crossbow.

## XP Gain

XP is gained whenever you shoot mobs with a crossbow.

## How does Trickshot work?

Trickshot is an passive ability, you shoot your bolts at a shallow angle with a crossbow to attempt a Trickshot. This will cause the arrow to ricochet off of blocks and potentially hit a target. The number of potential bounces from a ricochet depend on the rank of Trickshot.
