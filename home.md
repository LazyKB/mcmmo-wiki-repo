## What is mcMMO?

mcMMO is a renowned server-side modification for Minecraft with over 2.9 million downloads and counting. mcMMO introduces skills and abilities into Minecraft enhancing the native mechanics while extending the gameplay in ways that feel natural and require no client mods. mcMMO offers RPG experiences, leaderboards and parties all of which are completely [configurable](/config). Visit the [Installation Guide](/installation) to get started today.

On Jan 29, 2019, the development of McMMO branched into two separate versions: McMMO (Also known as McMMO Overhaul, or McMMO 2.x).

The modern version of McMMO is being developed full time by Nossr50. He is now pumping out constant updates, fixing bugs, and consistently adding in new content. The classic version of McMMO is being maintained by t00thpick1. He has no plans of adding any new features to the plugin, aiming to keep it the same as it was before McMMO split. He will focus on fixing bugs and making sure the plugin works in feature versions of Minecraft.

As of now, this wiki will not cover any information from the classic version of the plugin. Instead, the wiki will be focused solely on the modern version of McMMO.
